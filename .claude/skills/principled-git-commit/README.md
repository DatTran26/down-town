# principled-git-commit

English-only vendor copy of [rhino-ty/principled-git-commit](https://github.com/rhino-ty/principled-git-commit) for down-town.

Skip this skill when `ak:git` is present. Without `ak:git`, use this skill for atomic commits and secret blocking, then `caveman-commit` for the subject line (≤50).

This copy does **not** include `lang/ko` or non-English trigger lists. Commit subjects and bodies stay English. Project dialect: [`docs/references/COMMIT.md`](../../docs/references/COMMIT.md).

## What it adds on top of Conventional Commits

- Five principles: atomic, leaves-repo-green, why-over-what, imperative, searchable
- Five-step workflow: diff inspection → staging → type tree → secrets blocklist → checklist
- Breaking change / revert / amend protocols
- Dialect file for project-specific nouns and trailers
